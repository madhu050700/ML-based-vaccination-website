# ML-based-vaccination-website

Design and developed a covid vaccination website to ease the process of vaccination by providing the eligibility check for the users. 
Eligible people can book an appointment in the nearby hospitals based on their convenience. Post vaccination, telemonitoring is done for the vaccinated people for a period of 28 days. If a person faces any health issue during the monitoring period, an alert is sent to the nearby hospital. 
After the monitoring period, if no complication exists, the person is notified for the second dosage.
